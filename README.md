## AI Spreadsheet

This demo shows you how to implement an AI spreadsheet editor in Next.js with [Liveblocks](https://liveblocks.io/). 
It's based on the [collaborative spreadsheet](https://liveblocks.io/examples/collaborative-spreadsheet-advanced) example.
The AI spreadsheet editing tool is in [`Chat.tsx`](https://github.com/CTNicholas/ai-spreadsheet/blob/main/src/components/Chat.tsx).

### Set up Liveblocks

- [Book a demo](https://liveblocks.io/ai-copilots) to access AI Copilots
- Install all dependencies with `npm install`
- Create an account on [liveblocks.io](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard)
- Copy your **secret** key from the [dashboard](https://liveblocks.io/dashboard/apikeys)
- Create an `.env.local` file and add your **secret** key as the `LIVEBLOCKS_SECRET_KEY` environment variable
- Run `npm run dev` and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
